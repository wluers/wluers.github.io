## THIS BLOG REPOSITORY

This Jekyll blog will hold my research and essays on _Digital Cinema-Writing_ as a distinct practice of multimodal networked writing. I look at the history of an idea&mdash;writing with movement, image and sound&mdash; and its poetics and practice from early cinema to electronic literature to contemporary forms of vernacular digital writing.
