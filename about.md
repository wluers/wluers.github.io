## STATEMENT
As a primarily visual digital artist, my medium is the pixel grid. The pixel grid of an image, video or browser window, is a numeric, encoded, highly organized system that takes instruction, responds to error and interference, and is a surface for gestural expression and inscription. I explore this pixel space through a variety of often simultaneous compositional practices: cinema, painting, writing and programming.

I use core web technologies (HTML5, CSS and JavaScript) to manipulate image, video and text on a browser page. The web browser is not only versatile as an interactive composition space, is is also adaptable to a variety of venues and paths for exhibition and publication. My work is published as web apps and print-on-demand books, screened at film and video festivals, exhibited as wall-art and in installation at galleries and public spaces, and in performance with music and poetry. In all of these contexts, I want surfaces to provoke and startle in their abstraction and yet seem familiar as source material from our current moment of media saturation.

In my drafting and redrafting of a digital poetics and practice, I am drawn to work that pluralizes narrative sequence. If an idea or story can be generated from a single semiotic sequence, what might be generated with multiple, simultaneous and linked sequences in an interface or network? How does a non-linear juxtaposition of micro-narratives alter our sense of time and space? What new cinematic forms can we grow with our computational tools? This openended questioning of the digital puts me into an intuitive and improvisational composition process that plays with the edges of figuration and abstraction, narrative and indeterminacy, intention and chance. Most of my material is captured and remixed from daily life, but it is in post-production (editing, mark-up, programming, collaging) that I try to push beyond familiar representational forms to open up a temporal and spatial sense that is multiple and generative. My best work comes out of a dialogue between my intentions and the computerâ€™s ability to disrupt, extend and complicate those intentions.
